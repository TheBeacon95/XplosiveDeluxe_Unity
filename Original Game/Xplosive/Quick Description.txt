Entity Impl:
	What is an Entity:
	All objects that interact with the players as well as the players themselves are considered entities. eg.: Monsters, Explosions, Bombs, Items etc.
	Tiles and other Blocks are not considered Entities because they don't interact with the players. The players interact with them.
	
	What Entities do:
	- Some entities move (players, monsters, possibly some items) => RigidBody
	- They have sprites and animations
	- They have Colliders
	- They are all 1 x 1
	
	Responsibilities of Entity Impl:
	- Create entities:
	  - ? EntityManagerAbs => ExplosionManager, BombManager
	  - ? EntityFactoryAbs<T> => PlayerFactory, MonsterFactory
	- Keep track of certain entities and their positions 
	- Move entities
	- Delete entities
	
	
	(Make it so that Entity.Impl can call tell LevelManager to Explode with explosion Ifc and Position and have a bool returned.)
	
Util:
	Project that can be used by all others.
	- Injector class (Maybe call it ManagerLocator or something).
