<h3>1 Introduction</h3>
<p>  Just like the registered  version,  this  freeware  version
  consists of three parts.  The  XPLOSIVE  DUEL  GAME  is  of
  course the classic one. It is great fun when  two  or  more
  players happen to be in the vicinity. Find out, who is  the
  best player!</p>

<p>  The XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME is the  second  part  of  XPLOSIVE.
  Here the Triple Team and  many  ingenious  level  designers
  (whom we would like to thank again in  alphabetical  order:
  Frank & Florian Dietrich, Armin Herbertz,  Michael  Heuser,
  Stefan Kohl, Bjoern Stahmer) designed over one hundred (154
  to be exact) levels  which  you  (and  your  friends)  must
  solve. One to four players can participate and  their  task
  is to kill all the  monsters  (some  of  them  will  REALLY
  surprise you!). Warp codes will  keep  up  your  motivation
  since you can reenter the level in which you last died. The
  third and last part of  the  game  is  the  XPLOSIVE  LEVEL
  EDITOR. This tool allows you to  create  your  own  levels,
  test them, save them and make passwords for them.  You  can
  easily bundle single levels to sets of levels.</p>


<h3>2 Getting installed...</h3>
<p>  To install the  game,  copy  all  the  files  in  a  single
  directory (this is necessary for  all  the  parts  to  work
  consistently). Change into this directory if  you  want  to
  play the game.</p>


<h3>3 XPLOSIVE DUEL GAME</h3>
<p>  Start the XPLOSIVE DUEL GAME by typing <code>XDR <ENTER></code> at the
  DOS prompt. The title  screens  will  show  up.  Press  the
  <ESCAPE> key early to skip them (you cannot avoid the first
  first screen, though). The menu will show up.  Use  <CURSOR
  UP> and <CURSOR DOWN> to select (highlight) an option.  Use
  <SPACE> or <ENTER> to change the option.</p>

<p>  The options are:</p>

<dl><dt>  PLAYERS</dt><dd><p>2-4; select  the  number  of  the  participating
    players</p>

</dd>
<dt>  MATCH POINTS</dt><dd><p>1-9; determines the points a  player  needs
    to win a game</p>

</dd>
<dt>  BLOCKS</dt><dd><p>0-9;  the  block  density  in  the  game;  higher
    numbers mean more blocks</p>

</dd>
<dt>  MONSTERS</dt><dd><p>0-9; the monster density; higher  numbers  mean
    more monsters (you may like to select a  low  number,  if
    your computer is too slow for a high monster density).</p>

</dd>
<dt>  SELECT (MONSTERS)</dt><dd><p>switch on/ off the monsters  according
    to your liking by using <CURSOR LEFT>, <CURSOR RIGHT> and
    <SPACE>.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  LET'S GO</dt><dd><p>Starts the game.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  QUIT</dt><dd><p>Ends the game and saves the current options</p>

</dd></dl>
<p>  Now everything is ready for an exciting  XPLOSIVE  DUEL.  A
  sort of sennet sounds just  before  the  game  starts,  the
  screen fades out and fades in with the first level. In  the
  left area of the  screen  the  current  game  situation  is
  displayed while in the right area there is the score panel,
  showing the number of victories in a match for every single
  active  player.  Victory  means  survival.  And   that   is
  therefore the aim of  the  XPLOSIVE  DUEL  GAME:  survival!
  Challenge the other players and monsters and show them  who
  is the best by throwing bombs or heating them with a  flame
  thrower, so that they cannot react anymore and will  prefer
  the agony of death to  the  stress  of  the  game!  But  be
  careful: the fate may suddenly turn  against  you  and  you
  will certainly be very astonished to note  that  the  other
  players team up against you.</p>

<p>  Pressing <ESCAPE> "skips" a level: no one will get a point,
  the screen fades out and a new level fades in.  The  Triple
  Team strongly recommends, based on  their  own  experience,
  that the players may agree BEFORE the game on  the  use  of
  the <ESCAPE> key  to  prevent  physical  violence  because:
  "that idiot pressed <ESCAPE> again. That's enough!" (POW!).</p>

<p>  Holding down <ESCAPE> until the screen is dark returns  you
  to the menu.</p>


<h3>4 XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME</h3>
<p>  Start the XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME by typing  <code>XLR  xxxxxxxx.LEV
  <ENTER></code> at the DOS prompt. Exchange  <code>xxxxxxxx</code>  with  the
  level file you want to play. To start  the  game  with  the
  original Triple Team level files, start it with <code>XLR XP.LEV
  <ENTER></code>. The title screens will show up,  skip  them  with
  <ESCAPE> and the menu will fade in. Highlight an option  by
  using <CURSOR UP> and <CURSOR DOWN>. Change  an  option  by
  using <SPACE> or <ENTER>. The first option  is  the  PLAYER
  number, the second the number of LIVES.  The  third  option
  (WARP) is special: by using the number keys <1> to <4>  you
  can enter a warp code  which  will  warp  (teleport,  beam,
  move) you to the level in which you obtained that code.  At
  the beginning,  you  don't  know  a  code,  but  after  the
  completion of each level the appropriate warp code for  the
  following level will be displayed. However,  this  is  only
  true for the xp.lev file (113 levels). The  more  difficult
  levels found in pro.lev (41 levels) and adv.lev (60 levels,
  taken from both xp.lev and pro.lev) do  not  yield  a  code
  after each level. In order to avoid typing in  <code>XLR  XP.LEV
  <ENTER></code> at the DOS prompt each time, you  can  also  start
  any of the three  level  files  by  executing  one  of  the
  batches: PLAY_STD.BAT,  PLAY_ADV.BAT  and  PLAY_PRO.BAT.  A
  non-existing warp code lets you start with the first level.
  Feel free to fiddle around with these  codes,  but  beware:
  warping to a higher level accidentally a  beginner  doesn't
  stand a chance. The option LET'S GO starts the  game  while
  the option QUIT ends the game.</p>

<p>  In the game the left area of  the  screen  shows  the  game
  situation, while the right area (the "score panel"  of  the
  XPLOSIVE DUEL GAME) indicates, how many extra  lives  every
  players has.</p>

<p>  The <ESCAPE> key means "Surrender". You lose  a  life,  the
  level restarts and you can try to complete it. A  level  is
  completed if all the monsters are killed. A warp code  will
  show up (don't forget to scribble the code down!)  and  the
  next level will start. Since you must kill all monsters  to
  finish  a  level,  read  the  monster  descriptions   below
  carefully to find out, what you must do exactly to  kill  a
  specific monster.</p>

<p>  IMPORTANT NOTE: if you're really a hot shot, also  try  the
  PRO.LEV level files on your game disk.</p>


<h3>5 XPLOSIVE LEVEL EDITOR</h3>
<p>  Start the XPLOSIVE LEVEL EDITOR by typing <code>XE</code> at  the  DOS
  prompt. Don't get confused when the screen shows  up,  it's
  all very easy.</p>

<p>  IMPORTANT NOTE: You need a (Microsoft-compatible) mouse for
  the XPLOSIVE LEVEL EDITOR.</p>

<p>  In the left area of the screen is the level. In  the  right
  area are the different control options to edit the level.</p>

<p>  In the upper right corner, there are five buttons, to  make
  a NEW level, to LOAD a level, to SAVE a level,  to  TEST  a
  level, to select a warp CODE, and to return to DOS.</p>

<p>  Beside these buttons there are the elements with which  you
  can edit a level. There are  blocks,  the  extras  and  the
  monsters. Use the arrow buttons to scroll the lists up  and
  down. Pick out the element which you want to use and  place
  it in the level using the left mouse  key.  Note  that  the
  layout of the empty levels cannot be changed and trying  to
  put an element into one of the reserved positions  will  be
  rejected. You can change the players' starting position  by
  picking out the appropriate player and placing  it  on  the
  map. You  can  stack  monsters  and  players  on  the  same
  position but don't lose track. The right key of  the  mouse
  is used to delete single elements in the map. Monsters will
  be deleted first and then the map  element  is  changed  to
  floor. You cannot delete players.</p>

<p>  After you create a level you should enter a code  by  using
  the CODE option. Then you can TEST it (simply click on  the
  button and the XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME will start) or  SAVE  it
  (enter the level  name  WITHOUT  extension:  if  you  enter
  <code>STONED</code> as level, then <code>STONED.LEV</code> will be save). LOADing
  works much the same.</p>

<p>  Notes:</p>

<ul><li><p>Don't forget to place monsters in the levels. If you want
    a duel, play XPLOSIVE DUEL GAME.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Impossible things can be created with the editor  and  it
    won't complain. But  you  cannot  solve  these  kinds  of
    levels in the XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The editor cannot cope with multilevel sets. So,  if  you
    try to load the original levels (XP) it  will  only  load
    the very first of them.</p>

</li></ul>
<p>  XPLOSIVE LEVEL EDITOR only saves single  levels.  By  using
  the ordinary DOS <code>COPY</code> command you can bundle  several  of
  these files to a single file. Suppose you have <code>STONED.LEV</code>
  and <code>FIREFIRE.LEV</code> on  your  harddisk.  Type  in  <code>COPY  /B
  STONED.LEV + FIREFIRE.LEV SET.LEV</code> at  the  DOS  prompt  to
  produce <code>SET.LEV</code> which contains two levels (and that's why
  it is 468 bytes long). Start the XPLOSIVE LEVEL  GAME  with
  <code>XLR SET.LEV</code> and you can play these two levels  in  a  row
  with warp codes and all the stuff. If you know  how  <code>COPY</code>
  works you can probably  work  out  easier  ways  to  bundle
  levels, for example by given them  similar  names.  If  you
  have ten levels named <code>L0.LEV</code> to <code>L9.LEV</code> you can use  the
  following  command:  <code>COPY  /B  L?.LEV  SET.LEV</code>.   It   is
  important that you don't forget the  <code>/B</code>  switch  directly
  after the <code>COPY</code> command. Caution: don't delete your single
  levels since you can't edit them easily with  the  XPLOSIVE
  LEVEL EDITOR.</p>

<p>  One last hint concerning the warp codes: if  you  have  the
  same warp code twice or more times in a level set  it  will
  cause problems.</p>


<h3>6 Short summary of the game</h3>
<p>  You as player control a rabbit. You  can  move  the  rabbit
  using the direction keys described below. You can  plant  a
  bomb by using the fire  key.  A  bomb  will  explode  three
  seconds after it is planted, so make sure  that  you  won't
  get killed  by  the  explosion.  The  explosions  are  only
  horizontal and/  or  vertical.  Explosions  will  kill  you
  (unless you are invulnerable), certain  types  of  monsters
  (see the monster reference) and will atomize all extras and
  destructible blocks. If blocks are destroyed,  there  is  a
  chance, that extras will appear. These are described below.</p>


<h3>7 Keyboard reference</h3>
<p>  The four players use always  the  same  keys  in  both  the
  XPLOSIVE DUEL GAME and the XPLOSIVE LEVEL  GAME.  Here  are
  the keys:</p>
<PRE>
    Player Color   Up      Right    Left     Down    Fire
    1      Red     NUM: 8  NUM: 6   NUM: 4   NUM: 2  NUM: 0
                   (or use the cursor   keys)
    2      Yellow  W       D        A        S       CNTRL
    3      Green   P       Ä        L        Ö       R. SHIFT
    4      Blue    Z       J        G        H       V

</PRE>

<p>  You can also use KEYCFG.EXE to reconfigure  your  keyboard.
  If strange things happen, just  delete  <code>XPLOSIVE.CFG</code>  and
  start the XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME to get things fixed...</p>


<h3>8 The extras</h3>
<p>  In the XPLOSIVE LEVEL  GAME  and  the  XPLOSIVE  DUEL  GAME
  several extras appear in the game. You can  take  them  (by
  moving over them) or destroy them (by placing a  bomb  next
  to them). Sometimes you may wish to  do  the  latter  thing
  rather than the former in order to  prevent  other  players
  from getting stronger or you just don't like  the  risk  of
  taking the extras. The following extras appear in the game:</p>

<dl><dt>  Range extra</dt><dd><p>(looks  like  a  double  arrow)  this  extra
    increases the  range  of  your  explosions  by  one.  The
    starting range is two.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Bomb extra</dt><dd><p>(looks like a bomb with a plus  sign  on  it)
    this extra increases the number of  bombs  simultaneously
    available to discharge. The starting number is of  course
    one.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Risk extras</dt><dd><p>(look like question marks) these extras  can
    have different effects. Each of the four  question  marks
    available (red, green, blue, white) has a good effect and
    a bad effect. If you take a question mark,  the  computer
    randomly chooses between the two effects.  We  think  you
    should find out in detail which effect  belongs  to  each
    question mark: flame thrower  (the  fire  key  invokes  a
    flame thrower), slow motion (you're only half as fast  as
    usual),  confusion   (your   direction   keys   will   be
    exchanged), range reduction  (your  bomb  range  will  be
    reduced to one), stone explosion (the next explosion will
    cause blocks to appear), dematerialization (you can  move
    through solid rock, but are not invulnerable), auto  fire
    (you lay bombs automatically), invulnerability  (monsters
    and explosion won't harm  you).  Each  effect  lasts  ten
    seconds.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Star</dt><dd><p>(looks like, well,  you  can  guess  that...)  this
    extra comprises all the four good  effects  of  the  four
    question marks.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Shield</dt><dd><p>(...) take this extra to become invulnerable  for
    ten seconds. But be careful: if  you  take  another  risk
    extra, the effect probably will be deactivated. There can
    only be one special effect activated at a time.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Hour glass</dt><dd><p>(...)  stops  the  monsters  for  about  4.25
    seconds. Note that this time is  sufficient  to  plant  a
    bomb under them that will detonate before they spring  to
    life again.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Carrot</dt><dd><p>(...) eating this extras will speed you up for an
    indefinite amount of time. Beware: the slow motion  extra
    described above will negate the effects.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Exchange</dt><dd><p>(green arrow and white arrow in a circle,  sort
    of ying- yang)  this is probably the most fiendish  extra
    in the game and especially in  the  XPLOSIVE  DUEL  GAME.
    Many suggestions were made to abolish this extra and  put
    its use under severe punishment of law. But under  expert
    players as well as beginners this extra  will  cause  the
    most fun and satisfaction and  confusion.  What  are  the
    effects of this extra? Well, if you step on it, you and a
    randomly determined second player will  change  position.
    Why should this be so fiendish? Well, find out  yourself.
    Note that in the XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME and one player  mode
    nothing happens at all.</p>

</dd></dl>

<h3>9 The monsters</h3>
<p>  There are 16 different monsters in the XPLOSIVE  DUEL  GAME
  and the XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME. There are rumors, that in  the
  XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME some more monsters are to be found.  So
  watch out! Following is a  description  of  all  the  known
  monsters in alphabetical order.</p>

<dl><dt>  Critter</dt><dd><p>a critter is a furry creature that wants to  eat
    you. When you come near it, it will smell  you  and  will
    become very  excited  at  the  prospect  of  eating  you.
    Critters die in explosions.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Crusher</dt><dd><p>a crusher is a gleaming red creature  with  very
    big teeth. A crusher loves to eat rocks but is  otherwise
    harmless. A simple explosion will kill it. Crusher can be
    dangerous in  combination  with  other  monsters.  You'll
    see...</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Dwarf</dt><dd><p>dwarves love to surprise the players  by  stealing
    their bombs. They will  teleport  on  a  bomb  set  by  a
    player, disarm it,  put  it  in  a  great  blue  bag  and
    teleport again to escape.  A  simple  explosion  kills  a
    dwarf.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Extra eater</dt><dd><p>an extra eater paralyzes you for 1.5 seconds
    if you touch it (watch out for incoming explosions!).  It
    eats all the extras and is killed in a normal explosion.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Fireball</dt><dd><p>a fireball is a very nervous and  unpredictable
    creature. It will move to and fro and explode  from  time
    to time. Kill a fireball with a stone explosion.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Ghost</dt><dd><p>a ghost kills you, if you touch it, and is  easily
    killed in an explosion.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Golem</dt><dd><p>a golem is said to be a creature  made  of  stone.
    Our golem is not only made of  stone  but  also  has  the
    ability to make stone. So, if you see  a  golem  charging
    you from a distance, watch out, that he does not build  a
    wall around you which prevents your escape. Additionally,
    if you touch a golem, your character becomes  immediately
    confused (see the extras) for five seconds. This can be a
    nuisance, for you lose every other  special  effect  that
    may have been active. Golems can be killed. Because  they
    are so giant and  immensely  strong  creatures,  "normal"
    explosions do not knock them out but merely paralyze them
    for 4.25 seconds. But if they stand in the center  of  an
    explosion (a point in an explosion is called center  when
    in at least three different  direction  there  is  fire),
    they will get killed.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Killers</dt><dd><p>these evil creatures only  appear  in  packs  of
    three. They are very fast and their only goal it to  gnaw
    your ears off which is the  unhappiest  thing  which  can
    happen to a rabbit and will cause the  rabbit  to  commit
    suicide. Killers die in explosions.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Living wall</dt><dd><p>this monster is not  easily  recognized  and
    will often block the way of an unsuspecting player.  Kill
    a living wall by waiting on a crossroad until it moves on
    you. Then plant a bomb and flee. That means, if a  living
    wall is surrounded by fire in all the four directions  it
    will die.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Mage</dt><dd><p>a mage is very, very dangerous. It tries to get  at
    you and then it will kill you  with  its  attack  spells.
    Kill a mage like a golem.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Ninja</dt><dd><p>this monster kills you and is killed in explosion.
    Because it is only a ninja's  apprentice  it  is  not  so
    dangerous  after  all.  From  time  to  time  a   ninja's
    apprentice will stop  and  analyze  the  situation.  This
    makes it very vulnerable.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Pit</dt><dd><p>a pit is immobile. From time to time  it  will  open
    and kill every players who steps in  the  great  gap.  To
    kill a pit an explosion must hit it, while it is  opening
    or closing. Pits only appear in the XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Predator</dt><dd><p>they are invisible. Okay, if they move you will
    see them a little bit, but if they stand still you cannot
    see them. Predators kill you and die in explosions.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Slime</dt><dd><p>this  monster  can  change  its  appearance   and
    characteristics  and  that's  why  some  call  it   shape
    shifter. Slime can convert in a  golem,  a  ghost  and  a
    extra eater. It  will  return  to  slime  form,  when  it
    touches a bomb or after a specific time. When  it  is  in
    slime form, it is invulnerable. So, what you have  to  do
    to kill a slime, is to plant bombs in  a  distance.  They
    will kill it when it is in ghost or extra eater form.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Spider</dt><dd><p>a spider kills players and spins webs  from  time
    to time. If you step on a web you will be paralyzed for a
    short time and the web will disappear.  You  can  destroy
    webs with explosions just as the spider itself.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Turtle</dt><dd><p>a turtle is harmless but very easily  frightened.
    If you pester a turtle, it will stop and  block  the  way
    for all the monsters and players. An explosion causes the
    same behaviour. Brutal is it may sound, the only  way  to
    kill a turtle is a stone explosion.</p>

<h3>10 Remarks about the freeware version</h3>
<p>  This is the freeware version of XPLOSIVE, which is for  the
  most part identical to the registered version.</p>

<p>  The major difference is, that the freeware version  may  be

<h3>1 Einleitung</h3>
<p>  Genau  wie  die  Vollversion  von  Xplosive  besteht  diese
  Freeware Version aus drei Teilen. Das  XPLOSIVE  DUEL  GAME
  ist davon der klassische, der besonders viel  Spass  macht,
  wenn gerade ein bis drei potentielle Gegner in  der  Gegend
  herumlungern. Finden Sie heraus, wer von  Ihnen  der  beste
  Spieler ist oder töten sie alle Monster in  den  auf  Ihren
  Geschmack zugeschnittenen Leveln.</p>

<p>  Das XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME ist der zweite Teil  von  XPLOSIVE.
  Hier haben das Triple Team und viele  andere  Leveldesigner
  (denen wir hier noch einmal in  alphabetischer  Reihenfolge
  danken möchten: Frank & Florian Dietrich,  Armin  Herbertz,
  Michael Heuser, Stefan Kohl, Björn  Stahmer)  über  hundert
  (154, um genau zu sein) Level entworfen, die Sie (und  Ihre
  Freunde) lösen müssen. Ein bis vier  Spieler  sind  erlaubt
  und Ihre Aufgabe ist es, alle Monster zu töten  (von  denen
  einige eine  wirklich  grosse  Überraschung  für  Sie  sein
  werden).  Warp  Codes  sorgen   dafür,   dass   Sie   immer
  hochmotiviert  bleiben,  denn  Sie  können  in  den   Level
  springen, in dem Sie Ihr letztes Leben liessen. Der  dritte
  und letzte Teil des Spiels ist der XPLOSIVE  LEVEL  EDITOR.
  Mit diesem Werkzeug kreieren Sie Ihre eigenen,  teuflischen
  Level, testen sie, speichern sie und versehen sie mit einem
  Warp Code. Sie können auf einfache Art und  Weise  einzelne
  Level zu grossen Levelpaketen zusammenbinden.</p>


<h3>2 Installation</h3>
<p>  Um das Spiel zu installieren, kopieren Sie alle Dateien  in
  ein  einziges   Verzeichnis.   Wechseln   Sie   in   dieses
  Verzeichnis, wenn Sie das Spiel spielen wollen.</p>


<h3>3 XPLOSIVE DUEL GAME</h3>
<p>  Starten Sie das XPLOSIVE  DUEL  GAME,  indem  Sie  am  DOS-
  Prompt <code>XDR <RETURN></code> eingeben. Die Titelbilder werden  nun
  eingeblendet. Wenn Sie <ESCAPE>  drücken,  können  Sie  die
  Bilder  überspringen  (das  erste  Bild  wird  aber   immer
  gezeigt!). Nun wird das Menu angezeigt. Um eine  Option  zu
  selektieren, benutzen Sie <CURSOR HOCH> und <CURSOR
  RUNTER>.  Benutzen Sie <SPACE> oder <RETURN>, um die
  angewählte Option zu ändern. Es gibt folgende Optionen:</p>

<dl><dt>  PLAYERS</dt><dd><p>2-4; stellen  Sie  die  Zahl  der  teilnehmenden
    Spieler ein</p>

</dd>
<dt>  MATCH POINTS</dt><dd><p>1-9;  legt  die  Punktzahl  fest,  die  ein
    Spieler zum Gewinnen benötigt</p>

</dd>
<dt>  BLOCKS</dt><dd><p>0-9; legt  die  Blockdichte  während  des  Spiels
    fest; eine höhere Ziffer hat mehr Blöcke zur Folge</p>

</dd>
<dt>  MONSTERS</dt><dd><p>0-9; die Monsterdichte bestimmt  die  Zahl  der
    Monster im Spiel  (bei  langsameren  Computern  empfiehlt
    sich eine möglichst niedrige Monsterdichte!)</p>

</dd>
<dt>  SELECT</dt><dd><p>hier können Sie einzelne Monster vollkommen  nach
    Ihrem Geschmack ein- und ausschalten, indem  Sie  <CURSOR
    LINKS>, <CURSOR RECHTS> und <SPACE> benutzen.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  LET'S GO</dt><dd><p>startet das Spiel!</p>

</dd>
<dt>  QUIT</dt><dd><p>beendet  das  Spiel  und  speichert  den  aktuellen
    Menustatus.</p>

</dd></dl>
<p>  Nun ist also  alles  für  ein  aufregendes  XPLOSIVE  Duell
  bereit. Eine  Art  Fanfare  ertönt  kurz  bevor  das  Spiel
  beginnt. Der Bildschirm blendet sich aus und wieder mit dem
  ersten Level ein. Auf der linken Seite des Bildschirms wird
  die  aktuelle  Spielsituation  dargestellt,  während   ganz
  rechts eine Punktetafel ist, die für jeden aktiven  Spieler
  die Anzahl der Siege anzeigt. Siegen heisst in diesem  Fall
  ÜBERLEBEN! Das ist das Ziel  des  XPLOSIVE  DUEL  GAME:  zu
  überleben! Fordern Sie  die  anderen  Spieler  und  Monster
  heraus und zeigen Sie ihnen, wer der Beste ist. Werfen  Sie
  mit Bomben um sich oder  erhitzen  Sie  deren  Gemüter  mit
  einem Flammenwerfer, so dass Ihre  Gegner  die  Agonie  des
  Todes der Aufregung des Spiels vorziehen.  Aber  seien  Sie
  vorsichtig: allzuschnell  mag  das  Schicksal  sich  wieder
  gegen Sie wenden und Sie werden sehr überrascht sein,  wenn
  Sie bemerken, dass  die  anderen  Spieler  sich  gegen  Sie
  zusammenschliessen und Sie plötzlich allein auf weiter Flur
  stehen.</p>

<p>  Wenn  Sie  <ESCAPE>  drücken,  können   Sie   einen   Level
  "überspringen".  Kein  Spieler  wird   dann   einen   Punkt
  bekommen. Das  Triple  Team  empfiehlt  besonders  aufgrund
  eigener Erfahrungen die  Benutzung  der  <ESCAPE>-Taste  im
  Vorhinein mit den anderen Spieler genauestens abzusprechen,
  um gewalttätige  Ausschreitungen  zu  vermeiden,  nach  dem
  Motto: "Dieser Idiot hat schon wieder <ESCAPE>  gedrückt  -
  jetzt gibt es Saures!"</p>

<p>  Wenn Sie <ESCAPE> länger gedrückt halten,  können  Sie  zum
  Menu zurückkehren.</p>


<h3>4 XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME</h3>
<p>  Starten  Sie  das  XPLOSIVE  LEVEL  GAME,  indem  Sie  <code>XLR
  xxxxxxxx.lev  <ENTER></code>   an   der   Dos-Eingabeaufforderung
  eintippen. Ersetzen Sie hierbei <code>xxxxxxxx</code> durch den  Namen
  der Leveldatei, die Sie spielen wollen.  Um  beispielsweise
  das Spiel mit den mitgelieferten  156  Leveln  zu  starten,
  tippen Sie <code>XLR XP.LEV  <ENTER></code>.  Die  Titelbilder  werden
  angezeigt, lassen sich aber auch mit <ESCAPE> überspringen.
  Nun wird das Menu angezeigt. Selektieren  Sie  eine  Option
  mit <CURSOR HOCH> und <CURSOR  RUNTER>.  Ändern  Sie  diese
  Option mit <RETURN> oder <SPACE>. Die erste Option ist  die
  Spieleranzahl  (PLAYERS),  die  zweite   die   Lebensanzahl
  (LIVES).  Mit  der  dritten  Option  (WARP)  hat  es  etwas
  besonders auf sich:  mit  den  Zifferntasten  <1>  bis  <4>
  können Sie einen Warp Code einstellen. Am Anfang kennen Sie
  natürlich noch keinen Code, aber nach jedem Level wird  der
  Warp Code für den  folgenden  Level  angezeigt.  Dies  gilt
  allerdings nur  für  die  Datei  xp.lev  (113  Level).  Die
  anspruchsvolleren  Leveldateien  pro.lev  (41  Level)   und
  adv.lev (60 Level, die eine Zusammenstellung aus den besten
  Leveln von xp.lev und pro.lev sind) geben nicht nach  jedem
  Level einen Code heraus.</p>

<p>  Um die mühsame Eingabe <code>XLR XP.LEV  <ENTER></code>  auf  der  DOS
  Ebene zu vermeiden, kann man auch  einfach  eine  der  drei
  Batch  Dateien  aufrufen:  PLAY_STD.BAT,  PLAY_ADV.BAT  and
  PLAY_PRO.BAT. Wenn Sie einen falschen Warp  Code  eingeben,
  starten Sie mit dem ersten  Level.  Probieren  Sie  soviele
  Warp Codes aus, wie  Sie  wollen,  aber  Vorsicht:  in  den
  höheren Leveln hat ein Anfänger KEINE CHANCE!!  Die  Option
  LET'S GO startet das Spiel,  während  die  QUIT-Option  das
  Spiel beendet.</p>

<p>  Im  Spiel  stellt  die  linke  Seite  des  Bildschirms  die
  aktuelle Spielsituation dar, während auf der rechten  Seite
  (die Punktetafel vom XPLOSIVE  DUEL  GAME)  zu  sehen  ist,
  wieviele Extra-Leben jeder aktive Spieler noch hat.</p>

<p>  <ESCAPE> bedeutet: "Ich/ Wir  gebe(n)  auf".  Alle  Spieler
  verlieren ein Leben und jeder,  der  noch  mindestens  eins
  übrig hat, kann den Level noch mal von vorne  spielen.  Ein
  Level ist geschafft, wenn alle Monster getötet  sind.  Dann
  wird ein Warp  Code  angezeigt,  den  Sie  sich  am  besten
  notieren. Noch ein Tip: da Sie in jedem Level alle  Monster
  töten müssen, sollten Sie natürlich genau wissen,  wie  man
  das macht. Lesen Sie dazu  die  Monsterbeschreibung  weiter
  unten.</p>


<h3>5 XPLOSIVE LEVEL EDITOR</h3>
<p>  Starten Sie den XPLOSIVE LEVEL EDITOR, indem  Sie  <code>XE</code>  an
  der Dos-Eingabeaufforderung eingeben. Lassen Sie sich durch
  den erscheinenden Bildschirm nicht  verwirren,  alles  geht
  ganz einfach.</p>

<p>  WICHTIG: Sie brauchen eine (Microsoft-kompatible) Maus,  um
  den XPLOSIVE LEVEL EDITOR zu bedienen.</p>

<p>  Auf der linken Seite  des  Bildschirms  ist  Ihr  aktueller
  Entwurf zu  sehen,  während  auf  der  rechten  Seite  alle
  Elemente sind, um den Editor zu bedienen.</p>

<p>  Rechts oben sind  sechs  Knöpfe,  mit  denen  Sie  (in  der
  Reihenfolge  von  oben  nach  unten)  einen   neuen   Level
  beginnen, einen Level laden, einen Level  speichern,  einen
  Test durchführen, den Warp  Code  einstellen  oder  zu  Dos
  zurückzukehren können.</p>

<p>  Neben diesen Knöpfen finden Sie die Elemente, aus denen ein
  Level zusammengesetzt werden kann. Es gibt  Blöcke,  Extras
  und Monster. Benutzen Sie die abgebildeten Pfeilknöpfe,  um
  die Listen hoch und runter zu scrollen. Suchen Sie sich ein
  Element aus, das Sie für die Konstruktion  benutzen  wollen
  und klicken Sie  darauf.  Dann  können  Sie  es  im  linken
  Bereich durch weiteres Klicken  mit  der  linken  Maustaste
  verteilen. Beachten Sie,  dass  der  grundsätzliche  Aufbau
  eines leeren Levels (mit  unzerstörbaren  Aussenwänden  und
  Mittelsäulen)  nicht   geändert   werden   kann.   Um   die
  Startposition der Spieler zu ändern, suchen  Sie  sich  auf
  der rechten Seite den gewünschten Spieler heraus und setzen
  Sie ihn  dann  auf  der  linken  Seite  an  die  gewünschte
  Position. Mehrere  Monster  können  auf  dieselbe  Position
  gesetzt werden, aber passen Sie auf, dass Sie den Überblick
  nicht verlieren. Die  rechte  Maustaste  wird  benutzt,  um
  einzelne Elemente des Spielfeldes wieder zu löschen. Zuerst
  werden Monster gelöscht, danach die Felder. Spieler  lassen
  sich nicht löschen.</p>

<p>  Nachdem Sie einen Level entworfen haben, sollten Sie  einen
  CODE einstellen. Anschliessend lässt sich der Level mit dem
  TESTknopf ausprobieren oder mit dem  SAVEknopf  abspeichern
  (geben Sie hierbei  den  Levelnamen  OHNE  Dateierweiterung
  ein: wenn Sie beispielsweise <code>STEINIG</code> als Namen  eingeben,
  wird <code>STEINIG.LEV</code> abgespeichert).  Das  Laden  von  Leveln
  funktioniert genauso.</p>

<p>  Bemerkungen:</p>

<ul><li><p>Vergessen Sie nicht, Monster in einem Level zu plazieren.
    Wenn Sie wirklich ein Duell wollen, spielen Sie  XPLOSIVE
    DUEL GAME.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Im Editor  können  Sie  unmögliche  und  unlösbare  Dinge
    kreieren, ohne dass Sie eine Fehlermeldung erhalten. Aber
    Sie können diese Art von Leveln nicht  mit  dem  XPLOSIVE
    LEVEL GAME erfolgreich spielen.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Der Editor kann nicht mit Blockleveln (mehrere  Level  in
    einer Datei) umgehen. Also, wenn  Sie  zum  Beispiel  die
    Originallevel laden wollen (XP) wird  er  Ihnen  nur  den
    allerersten Level anzeigen!</p>

</li></ul>
<p>  Der XPLOSIVE LEVEL EDITOR speichert nur einzelne Level  ab.
  Mit  dem  ganz  normalen  DOS  'COPY'-Kommando  können  Sie
  allerdings einzelne Leveldateien zu  einer  Blockleveldatei
  zusammenbinden. Nehmen wir an, Sie hätten <code>STEINIG.LEV</code> und
  <code>FEUER.LEV</code> auf Ihrer  Festplatte  gespeichert.  Geben  Sie
  einfach <code>COPY /B STEINIG.LEV + FEUER.LEV  SET.LEV</code>  an  der
  DOS-Eingabeaufforderung ein, um <code>SET.LEV</code>, der  zwei  Level
  enthält, zu produzieren. Starten  Sie  das  XPLOSIVE  LEVEL
  GAME  mit  <code>XLR  SET.LEV</code>   und   Sie   können   die   zwei
  ursprünglichen  Level   hintereinander   mit   Warp   Codes
  durchspielen.  Wenn  Sie  sich  mit   dem   'COPY'-Kommando
  auskennen, können Sie  einfachere  Wege  finden,  um  Level
  zusammenzubinden,  indem  Sie  den  Einzeldateien  ähnliche
  Namen geben. Wenn Sie zum Beispiel zehn Level mit den Namen
  <code>L0.LEV</code> bis  <code>L9.LEV</code>  haben,  könnten  Sie  das  folgende
  Kommando  benutzen:  <code>COPY  /B  L?.LEV  SET.LEV</code>.  Es   ist
  wichtig, dass Sie nicht das  <code>/B</code>  unmittelbar  hinter  dem
  <code>COPY</code>  vergessen.  Vorsicht:  löschen   Sie   nicht   Ihre
  einzelnen Leveldateien, denn ansonsten können Sie nicht auf
  einfache Art und Weise einen der  Level  mit  dem  XPLOSIVE
  LEVEL EDITOR verändern.</p>

<p>  Noch ein letzter Tip zu den Warp Codes: wenn Sie  denselben
  Warp Code zwei- oder mehrmals in  einem  Levelpaket  haben,
  gibt es Probleme!</p>


<h3>6 Kurze Zusammenfassung des Spiels</h3>
<p>  Sie als Spieler kontrollieren einen Hasen. Sie  können  den
  Hasen  mit   den   Richtungstasten   bewegen,   die   unten
  beschrieben werden. Mit  der  Feuertaste  können  Sie  eine
  Bombe legen. Diese wird drei Sekunden, nachdem  Sie  gelegt
  wurde, explodieren. Stellen Sie also sicher, dass Sie nicht
  getötet werden, indem Sie das Weite suchen. Die Explosionen
  selbst  sind  nur  waagerecht   und   /   oder   senkrecht.
  Explosionen töten Sie (wenn Sie nicht  unverwundbar  sind),
  einige  Monstertypen  (lesen  Sie  dazu  das  Monstermanual
  weiter unten) und sprengen alle Extras,  sowie  zerstörbare
  Blöcke. Wenn ein Block zerstört wird, besteht eine  gewisse
  Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass ein Extras  unter  ihm  erscheinen
  wird. Diese sind weiter unten beschrieben.</p>


<h3>7 Tastaturbelegung</h3>
<p>  Die vier Spieler  benutzen  normalerweise  immer  dieselben
  Tasten sowohl im XPLOSIVE DUEL GAME als  auch  im  XPLOSIVE
  LEVEL GAME. Hier ist die Belegung:</p>
<PRE>
    Hase Position     Oben    Rechts Links   Unten  Feuer
    1    Rechts unten NUM: 8  NUM: 6 NUM: 4  NUM: 2 NUM: 0
    2    Links oben   W       D      A       S      STRG
    3    Rechts oben  P       Ä      L       Ö      R. SHIFT
    4    Links unten  Z       J      G       H      V

</PRE>

<p>  Es ist jedoch möglich mit der beigefügten KEYCFG.EXE- Datei
  eine  neue  Belegung  zu  wählen.  Sollte   es   dabei   zu
  irgendwelchen Komplikationen kommen, so löschen Sie einfach
  die 'XPLOSIVE.CFG'-Datei und starten Sie <code>XLR.EXE</code>.</p>


<h3>8 Die Extras</h3>
<p>  Im XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME und im XPLOSIVE DUEL GAME erscheinen
  einige Extras. Sie  können  diese  nehmen  oder  zerstören.
  Manchmal werden  Sie  eher  die  Extras  zerstören  wollen,
  entweder um andere Spieler  daran  zu  hindern  stärker  zu
  werden, oder, weil Sie nicht das  Risiko  auf  sich  nehmen
  wollen, einmal einen schlechten Effekt  zu  erwischen.  Die
  folgenden Extras erscheinen während des Spiels:</p>

<dl><dt>  Reichweiten-Extra</dt><dd><p>(sieht aus wie ein roter  Doppelpfeil)
    dieses Extra erhöht die Reichweite Ihrer  Explosionen  um
    eins. Die Anfangsreichweite beträgt zwei Felder.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Bomben-Extra</dt><dd><p>(sieht  aus  wie  eine  Bombe   mit   einem
    Pluszeichen  -  vorsicht,  Verwechslungsgefahr!)   dieses
    Extra erhöht die Zahl der Bomben,  die  Sie  gleichzeitig
    legen können. Am Anfang können Sie nur eine Bombe legen.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Risiko-Extras</dt><dd><p>(sehen aus wie Fragezeichen) dieses  Extra
    kann   verschiedene   Effekte   haben.   Es   gibt   vier
    verschiedene Fragezeichen (rot, grün,  blau  und  weiss).
    Jedes von ihnen hat  einen  guten  und  einen  schlechten
    Effekt. Wenn Sie Fragezeichen nehmen, wählt der  Computer
    zufällig aus, welchen Effekt Sie  bekommen.  Wir  denken,
    dass Sie am besten selbst  herausfinden,  hinter  welchem
    Fragezeichen sich welche der folgenden Extras  verbergen:
    Flammenwerfer (mit der Feuertaste können  Sie  nun  einen
    Flammenwerfer auslösen), Langsamkeit (damit sind Sie  nur
    halb   so   schnell   wie   normal),   Verwirrung    (die
    Tastaturbelegung Ihrer Richtungstasten wird  vertauscht),
    Reichweitenverringerung (Ihre Reichweite  wird  auf  eins
    reduziert), Steinexplosion  (in  der  nächsten  Explosion
    werden Steine erscheinen), Dematerialisierung (Sie können
    nun selbst durch festes Gestein hindurchgehen, aber  sind
    nicht unverletzlich), Autofeuer (Sie  legen,  ob  Sie  es
    wollen oder nicht, automatisch Bomben),  Unverwundbarkeit
    (Explosionen und Monster machen Ihnen nichts  mehr  aus).
    Jeder dieser Effekte dauert zehn Sekunden an.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Joker</dt><dd><p>(sieht aus wie  ein  Stern!)  unter  diesem  Extra
    finden sich alle  vier  guten  Effekte  der  Fragezeichen
    (Unverwundbarkeit,  Dematerialisierung,   Steinexplosion,
    Flammenwerfer).</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Schild</dt><dd><p>nehmen Sie ihn, um für zehn Sekunden unverwundbar
    zu werden. Aber seien Sie vorsichtig: wenn Sie  irgendein
    anderes   Risikoextra    nehmen,    wird    der    Effekt
    wahrscheinlich deaktiviert. Es kann immer nur ein  Effekt
    gleichzeitig aktiviert sein.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Stundenglas</dt><dd><p>lähmt  die  Monster  für   4,25   Sekunden.
    Hinweis: diese Zeit reicht aus, um schnell eine Bombe  zu
    legen, die ein Monster in die Luft sprengt, noch bevor es
    wieder zum Leben erwacht.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Möhre</dt><dd><p>verdoppelt   ihre   Geschwindigkeit   für   eine
    unbegrenzte Zeit. Passen Sie  auf  das  Langsamkeitsextra
    (kleiner Tip: Blaues Fragezeichen!) auf: Es  negiert  den
    Effekt der Möhre; noch schlimmer, es macht  Sie  halb  so
    schnell wie normal.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Austausch-Extra</dt><dd><p>(sieht aus wie -  für  deutsche  Spieler
    vollkommen klar!)  Dieses Extra ist  höchstwahrscheinlich
    das teuflischste Extra im gesamten Spiel und besonders im
    XPLOSIVE DUEL GAME. Viele Stimmen erhoben sich, um dieses
    Extra zu verbannen  und  seine  Benutzung  unter  höchste
    Strafe zu stellen. Unter XPLOSIVE Xperten wie auch  unter
    Anfängern wird dieses Extra den grössten  Spass  und  die
    grösste Befriedigung auf der einen Seite verursachen  und
    die grösste Verwirrung und Wut auf der anderen Seite. Was
    macht das  Austausch-Extra?  Nun,  wenn  Sie  es  nehmen,
    tauschen Sie und ein zufällig bestimmter  Mitspieler  die
    Plätze. Und was ist daran so teuflisch?  Am  besten,  Sie
    finden das selbst heraus. Bemerkung: im Ein-Spieler-Modus
    von XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME macht das Austausch-Extra  keinen
    grossen Spass.</p>

</dd></dl>

<h3>9 Die Monster</h3>
<p>  Es gibt 16 verschiedene Monster im XPLOSIVE DUEL  GAME  und
  im XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME. Es gibt aber auch gewisse Gerüchte,
  die besagen, dass im XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME womöglich noch ein
  paar mehr Monster zu finden sind. Also, immer auf  der  Hut
  sein! Es folgt eine Beschreibung der bekannten  Monster  in
  alphabetischer Reihenfolge.</p>

<dl><dt>  Critter</dt><dd><p>ein Critter ist eine pelzige  Kreatur,  die  Sie
    essen will. Wenn Sie sich einem Critter nähern,  wird  er
    Sie riechen und seine grosse Aufregung spiegelt sich dann
    in seinen eiligen  Bewegungen  wieder.  Wie  auch  immer,
    Critter sterben in einer normalen Explosion.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Crusher</dt><dd><p>ein   Crusher   ist   ein   leuchtend   rotes,
    freundliches Monster mit sehr grossen Zähnen.  Mit  ihnen
    zermalmt der ansonsten harmlose Crusher liebend gern  die
    grössten Felsen. Eine  einfache  Explosion  tötet  dieses
    liebe Tier. Crusher können  in  Kombination  mit  anderen
    Monstern auf indirekte Weise recht gefährlich werden. Sie
    werden es herausfinden.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Extrafresser</dt><dd><p>er lähmt Sie bei Berührung für 1,5 Sekunden
    (Vorsicht,  wenn  Sie  irgendwelche  Explosionen  in  der
    Umgebung erwarten!). Ausserdem frisst er alle Extras (was
    in einem ganz besonderem Fall von  Nutzen  sein  kann...)
    und stirbt in einer normalen Explosion.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Fallgrube</dt><dd><p>eine Fallgrube ist unbeweglich.  Von  Zeit  zu
    Zeit öffnet sie sich und tötet jeden, der sich nah  genug
    an den Abgrund wagt. Um eine Fallgrube zu  "töten",  muss
    sie von einer Explosion genau während des Öffnungs-  oder
    Schliessvorgangs getroffen werden. Fallgruben gibt es nur
    im XPLOSIVE LEVEL GAME.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Feuerball</dt><dd><p>eine  Feuerball  hat  eine  sehr  nervöse  und
    unvorhersehbare Persönlichkeit. Er  bewegt  sich  unruhig
    von der einen zur anderen Ecke ohne irgendein erkennbares
    Ziel. Von Zeit zu Zeit explodiert er. Um einen  Feuerball
    zu töten, muss man ihn unter Stein  begraben:  mit  einer
    Steinexplosion.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Geist</dt><dd><p>ein Geist tötet Sie, wenn Sie ihn berühren, lässt
      sich aber leicht mit einer normalen Explosion töten.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Golem</dt><dd><p>ein Golem ist  der  Legende  nach  ein  Wesen  aus
    Stein. Unser Golem ist nicht nur  aus  Stein  erschaffen,
    sondern macht auch Stein. Wenn Sie einen  Golem  aus  der
    Entfernung auf Sie zu marschieren sehen, passen Sie  also
    auf, dass er Sie nicht bei  lebendigem  Leibe  einmauert.
    Zusätzlich wird Ihr Spieler immer arg verwirrt,  wenn  er
    auf  einen  Golem  trifft.  Dieser  Effekt  dauert   fünf
    Sekunden an. Golems kann man töten. Weil Golems so riesig
    und unglaublich stark  sind,  werden  sie  durch  normale
    Explosionen nicht getötet sondern nur  für  eine  gewisse
    Zeit gelähmt.  Wenn  ein  Golem  aber  im  Zentrum  einer
    Explosion steht (ein  Punkt  in  einer  Explosion  heisst
    Zentrum, wenn von ihm mindestens in drei Richtungen Feuer
    ausgeht),  kann  auch  er  nicht  mehr  standhalten   und
    schmilzt!</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Killers</dt><dd><p>dieses  teuflischen  Kreaturen  treten  nur  in
    Dreierpacks  auf.  Sie  sind  sehr   schnell   und   ihre
    Lebensaufgabe ist es, Ihnen die  Ohren  abzubeissen,  was
    bei weitem die unglücklichste Sache ist, die einem  Hasen
    passieren kann. Jeder  halbwegs  anständige  Hase  begeht
    darauf hin Selbstmord. Killer sterben in  einer  normalen
    Explosion.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Lebende Wand</dt><dd><p>um dieses Monster zu erkennen,  braucht  es
    schon  einer  gehörigen  Portion  Erfahrung   und   einen
    scharfen Blick. Lebende Wände verbauen oft nichtsahnenden
    Spielern den Weg. Töten Sie eine lebende Wand, indem  Sie
    auf einer Kreuzung warten, bis  die  Wand  sich  auf  Sie
    bewegt! Legen Sie dann eine  Bombe  und  suchen  Sie  das
    Weite. Also, eine lebende Wand stirbt, wenn sie in  allen
    vier  Richtungen  von  Feuer  umgeben   ist.   Die   oben
    angeführte Methode ist dafür die gebräuchlichste Lösung.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Magier</dt><dd><p>ein Magier ist sehr, sehr gefährlich. Er probiert
    Sie mit seinem mächtigen Angriffszaubern  zu  töten.  Ein
    Magier lässt sich wie ein Golem töten  und  ausserdem  in
    Stein einmauern.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Ninja</dt><dd><p>diese Tötungsmaschine lässt sich in einer normalen
    Explosion töten. Weil dieser Ninja nur ein Lehrling  ist,
    ist er allerdings noch nicht so gefährlich: von  Zeit  zu
    Zeit hält er einfach an und stoppt alle Aktionen, um  die
    aktuelle Situation genaustens zu analysieren.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Predator</dt><dd><p>er ist unsichtbar. Okay, wenn er  sich  bewegt,
    kann man ihn gerade  noch  sehen.  Predators  wollen  Sie
    töten und sterben in normalen Explosionen.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Schildkröte</dt><dd><p>eine  Schildkröte  ist  harmlos  aber  sehr
    ängstlich. Wenn Sie sich einer Schildkröte zu sehr nähern
    oder  es  ihr  zu  heiss  wird,  wird   sie   alle   ihre
    Extremitäten und ihren Kopf einziehen und Ihnen  den  Weg
    versperren. So brutal es auch klingen mag, gibt es keinen
    anderen Weg, die Schildkröte zu beseitigen,  als  sie  in
    einer Steinexplosion einzumauern.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Schleim</dt><dd><p>dieses Monster  kann  sein  Aussehen  und  seine
    Eigenschaften verändern und wird deshalb von einigen auch
    Gestaltenwandler genannt. Ein Schleim kann sich in  einen
    Extrafresser, einen Geist oder  einen  Golem  verwandeln.
    Immer wenn der Schleim eine Bombe berührt, wird  er  sich
    in seine ursprüngliche Form zurückverwandeln.  In  dieser
    Form ist ein Schleim unverwundbar. So, alles, was Sie tun
    müssen, um einen Schleim  zu  töten,  ist  es  Bomben  zu
    legen, so dass eine Explosion ihn  erwischt,  während  er
    gerade in seiner Extrafresser- oder Geistform ist.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Spinne</dt><dd><p>eine Spinne tötet Spieler und spinnt von Zeit  zu
    Zeit ein Netz, das Sie lähmt. Sie können die Netze  genau
    wie die Spinne in einer normalen Explosion töten.</p>

</dd>
<dt>  Zwerg</dt><dd><p>Zwerge lieben es Spieler zu überraschen, indem sie
    deren sorgfältig plazierte  Bomben  einfach  klauen.  Sie
    teleportieren sich auf die Bombe, entschärfen sie, packen
    diese in einen grossen, blauen Beutel, den sie IMMER  mit
    sich führen, und teleportieren sich aus der  Gefahrenzone
    heraus. Eine einfache Explosion tötet einen Zwerg.</p>
